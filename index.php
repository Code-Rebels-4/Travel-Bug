Vavuniya District was thereafter ruled by Vanniar Chieftains who paid tribute to the pre-colonial Jaffna kingdom.The district then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of Ceylon. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The district, which was then called Vanni District, was part of the Tamil administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces.Vanni District, together with Jaffna District and Mannar District, formed the new Northern Province.">

Mannar is known for its baobab trees and for its fort, built by the Portuguese in 1560 and taken by the Dutch in 1658 and rebuilt; its ramparts and bastions are intact, though the interior is largely destroyed. Visually, the modern town is dominated by its churches, Hindu temples and mosques. The Catholic Church has a diocese headquartered in the town.

A beautiful, wide expanse of water that divides the old town from the new. In the 16th and 18th centuries, Matara was ruled by the Portuguese and the Dutch. Culture and architecture can still be seen in the area. The popular Lighthouse in Point Dondra was built by the Dutch and is considered to be one of the most beautiful and oldest lighthouses in Sri Lanka. Matara is a busy, booming and thriving commercial city that owes almost nothing to tourism â which can turn it into a fascinating window of modern Sri Lankan life. The main attractions of Matara are its ramparts, Dutch architecture, well-preserved fortress and street life.">

                        <div class="des" style="font-size: 15px; color: black;">Sinhala and Tamil New Year, locally known as Aluth Avurudda, is a significant celebration in Sri Lanka, embracing the traditional New Year of both the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. Widely observed by people of diverse backgrounds, this festive occasion aligns with the new year festivities of various South and Southeast Asian calendars. The festival, marked by the sighting of the new moon, is a public holiday in Sri Lanka, often observed on either April 13 or 14. During this time, many businesses close for about a week, creating a vibrant and joyous atmosphere across the country. Join in the festivities as Sri Lankans come together to usher in the New Year with cultural richness and traditional customs.</div>

                        <div class="des" style="font-size: 15px;">Vesak, also known as Buddha Jayanti or Buddha Purnima, is the most important Buddhist festival celebrated across South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tibet, and Mongolia. It honors the birth, enlightenment, and passing of Gautama Buddha in Theravada, Tibetan Buddhism, and Navayana traditions. The festival's name is derived from the lunar month of Vaisakha, corresponding to Buddha's birth month. While East Asian traditions celebrate Buddha's Birthday around Vesak, other holidays like Bodhi Day and NibbÄna Day mark separate events in his life. In South Asia, Vesak aligns with the full moon day of Vaisakha, symbolizing the Buddha's significant life events. Join Buddhists in commemorating Vesak, a time of cultural and spiritual reflection on the teachings and legacy of Gautama Buddha.</div>

                        <div class="des" style="font-size: 15px;">Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, signifies the triumph of good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. Celebrated between mid-September and mid-November, it spans five to six days and is associated with events like Rama's return and revered deities like Lakshmi and Ganesha. While rooted in Hinduism, Diwali is embraced by Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, and others. The festivities include illuminating spaces with lamps, ritual oil baths, fireworks, rangoli designs, and communal feasts. Diwali fosters family and community bonds, with diverse communities coming together for parades, fairs, and shared celebrations. It is a joyous occasion transcending religious boundaries, symbolizing light, unity, and cultural richness.</div>

                        <div class="des" style="font-size: 15px;">Pongal, also called Thai Pongal, is a multi-day Hindu harvest festival celebrated by Tamils in the month of Thai. Typically occurring on January 14 or 15, it honors the Sun God, Surya, and corresponds to the broader Indian harvest festival of Makar Sankranti. The festival includes three main days: Bhogi Pongal, Surya Pongal, and Mattu Pongal, with some also observing a fourth day known as Kanum Pongal. Traditionally symbolizing the end of winter solstice, Pongal involves preparing a ceremonial dish of rice boiled in milk with jaggery. Mattu Pongal highlights the celebration of cattle, involving bathing and adorning them. The festival is marked by decorative kolam artworks, prayers, family gatherings, and gift exchanges, fostering social bonds and renewal. Discover the vibrant traditions and cultural richness of Pongal, a joyful celebration of harvest and community.</div>
